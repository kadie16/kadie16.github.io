My Mother's Daughter 

Last week my mom came to visit. We had fun exploring the Asian Civilization Museum where we learned about Buddhist art and our Chinese Zodiac Signs.

Believe it or not I never considered myself a competitive person until you (may or may not) know what. Haha. In hindsight there were a couple Monopoly games I took too seriously... but I usually blamed any competitiveness on my Mom's competitiveness. Like anything else that is wrong with me lol.

On a related note, on the third or fourth day my mom was here, we discovered that she didn't have her passport. Hahaha. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree! After she accepted the fact that I hadn't mistaken her passport for mine and buried it in my things, she started taking measures to get a new one. First, she called the police. 

*ring ring*
“Hello, is this the Tanglin Police Department?”
“Uhhhhhhhhh ……………….” 
"I'm from the United States, I've lost my passport" 
"...."
"...."
“Um, you’ve reached a hospital …..”
“Oh, is this ###,####?”
“Uh I don’t really know the number that you called in on ….”
“Oh well, this number is listed as the Tanglin Police Department … I’ve lost my passport  … can you give me the number to the Singapore Police please? ”
“Ummmm” * “I’m in Nebraska…"

*twangy voice , chewing gum 
 After she sorted everything out and got a temporary passport from the embassy, we laughed about this conversation until we cried. 

Now you know where my tendency to misplace things comes from :p 

I won't bore you too much with the details of us doing touristy stuff, but one of the highlights was seeing the "super trees". There is a light show every night where .... but here are some pics of the other stuff we did.
