Santa Barbara City College is the best college ever and going there was easily the smartest decision I have ever made. </p> 



<p> I love to spend time in different places and I try to take trips whenever I have an opportunity, which has led me to this adventure :) I like to paint, lift, run, snorkel, skydive, scubadive, be in the ocean, play with my friend's dogs, and try new activities. I also like to read, be lazy, trade pins at disneyland, cuddle with my Boov named J.Lo. and read Boov books, play neopets, and eat the same kind of food over and over again. </p>

	This summer I am going to live and work in Singapore. During the week, I will be conducting research at the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC) at the Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR) with the Geometrical Modeling Group. Before my internship starts, I am visiting friends in Thailand and Australia! I intend to travel every weekend until I run out of money. </p> 


<p>   I feel so lucky in life. I have hard times too. I think that is  important to say that because we usually only advertise the fun stuff we do in life, and hide the bad stuff. And then we all start feeling like we are alone in our hardships. At least I have felt that way. I am so grateful for everyone I know, because they all have contributed to the richness of my experience. Shout out to the people I know omg I just love you all so much! I am also really really happy that you are reading my blog. The fact that you have made it three paragraphs in amazes me. I know this is super corny but I'm serious!! </p>
