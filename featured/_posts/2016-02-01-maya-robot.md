This semester I am taking a decal called UCBUGG, which stands for UC Berkeley Undergraduate Graphics Group. We are learning how to make an animated short using maya! This is my first maya project. He is a little robot. I don't have a name for him but I think he is pretty cute. Some people said he looks like a penguin. My former supervisor Like thinks he looks like a bumble bee :)

I used [this tutorial](http://ucbugg-labs.wikispaces.com/Introduction+to+Maya) to make this little guy. It was super helpful! The whole website has a lot of great tutorials if you are just starting out with Maya like I am.
