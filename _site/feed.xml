&lt;p&gt;My passport was literally delivered to Emily and Morgan’s (my friends in LA) apartment yesterday. If you know me, that probably isn’t surprising. I ran into a bunch of passport issues a month before my trip but it made it just in time! So far I haven’t lost anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks have gone by so fast. I finished finals, visited friends in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Los Angeles, and my home in San Diego. Two weeks between school and my trip didn’t feel like enough time, but now I am so excited to be on my way. I have a short layover in seattle, and then a 17 hour flight to Singapore with a stop in Tokyo. When I arrive in Singapore, I will wait a few hours until my next flight to Thailand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;packing-and-planning&quot;&gt;Packing and Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday night, my friend Sarah told me she would be in Koh Phi Phi for a few days before I am leave for Australia. So, I found a plane ticket for the earliest possible flight to Krabi, Thailand, and from there I will take a ferry to Koh Phi Phi. Thailand is one of the places I want to go to the most, so I am stoked I get to so early in my trip! I definitely want to see Bangkok another time this summer. Plus, the fact that I am seeing a familiar face when I get there is making everything a lot less intimidating. Convienently, there was a problem with the payment for my flights to Australia, so all of the flights were booked except from Singapore to Australia. This ended up being perfect because now I am flying directly to Australia from Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadie16/kadie16.github.io/master/assets/images/posts/en-route%20/packed.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Too Much Stuff&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I was going to bring all of this to Singapore. &lt;em&gt;Thank god&lt;/em&gt; I came to my senses. I went through all my stuff on my second to last night and decided to leave behind everything in and around the duffel bag on the left. I still feel overpacked and I seriously don’t know what the hell I was thinking when I packed the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still ended up checking my suitcase. When I got on the plane it wouldn’t fit in the overhead bin (lol oops). Thankfully the flight attendents were extremely nice and accomodating. They even helped me try to rearrange some things in my bag to see if it would fit. It was a pleasant experience and it’s easier to check it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;bye bye little suitcase!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;last-nights&quot;&gt;Last Nights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my second to last night in San Diego I went out in North Park with Thomy and Anthony, two of my best friends from my hometown. When we got home we stayed up until four in the morning reminiscing about all the funny things we did together in high shool. Like when Anthony taught me and Thomy how to drive, and other, more stupid stuff that I can not write about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next night me and my dad walked and talked on the beach and later I cuddled and ate take out olive garden with my mom and sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I had more sleepover talk with Morgan, Emily, Jules, Josh, Nate, and Sean in LA :). We got take out sushi and a delicious breakfast delivered (brownie, pancakes, eggs, potatoes, toast, granola with fresh fruit and yogurt). Breakfast is my favorite meal. I so enjoyed visiting with all of them and they made me even more excited for my trip! I was so happy to be with everyone that I got a little sad because I would miss them, but it was sad happy because I am just thankful that I have so many people I love enough to miss :) It was the perfect way to spend my last nights :heart_eyes_cat:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Airports For Days</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I got to Singapore last night at 11:30 PM on the 3rd. Now it is about 10:00 am local time and I am on my plane to Krabi, Thailand :) I enjoy flying, so I didn’t find my flights to be that bad. I slept most of the way and I had fun exploring the Tokyo gift shops during my layoever in Japan. I thought the flight from Tokyo to Singapore was 2 hours until I asked the person next to me (it was 6 hours lol). He was an american who was living in Bali, and he showed me photos of his beautiful 3 story house made entirely out of Bamboo. The floors, blinds, doors, and furniture were all made from different kinds of bamboo. It looked like a giant tree house in the jungle. The upstairs area was completely open, so there weren’t any full walls, only blinds for when it rained. He said bees and bats and snakes all came in and out of the house as they pleased. His children attended a private school that was also completely made out of bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my flights were only 10 hours apart, I decided to just stay at the airport last night. I reserved a “nap room” at the Haven Lounge in the Changi Airport before I left the US. After I went through immigration, I asked someone where the lounge was. At first, he seemed super concerned and told me that there were no lounges outside immigration, but eventually he realized what I was talking about and told me to take the SkyTrain to “&lt;em&gt;foreign sounding word&lt;/em&gt; tree”. So I got on the SkyTrain and rode it back and forth once, looking for a stop with the word tree in it, until I realized he was probably actually saying “terminal three”. I wandered around some more and eventually found the lounge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept in the nap room until 6:30, and then I packed my things and got a key to use a shower room. The shower had three showerheads, and when I leaned inside to turn it on, it was set to the one that happened to be pointed outside of the shower, directly at my face. So a huge stream of water started spraying straight to my face hahaha. I screamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost went to have breakfast at McDonalds until I asked where I could fill up my water bottle and realized the lounge had free snacks. I had a nice breakfast of toast, cereal, two apples, and a cappucino before I left to catch my flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Singapore Changi Airport is really beautiful. There are gardens and art installations and shops everywhere. I stepped outside to take a photo and feel the weather and I started sweating within a minute. I didn’t get the photo because I’m still figuring out the go pro lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this airport, you don’t have to go through security until you reach your gate. It was nice because there were only three people in front of me in the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get to Krabi, I am taking a bus to a resturaunt travel agency thing, then a shuttle to the dock, and then a ferry to koh phi phi, where Sarah and Ryan will be waiting for me :)&lt;/p&gt;
