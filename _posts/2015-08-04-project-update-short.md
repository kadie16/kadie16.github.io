My project is a C++ program that reads in data describing 3D models, in .obj file format, and renders and lights the models with OpenGL. Since my last post, I have implemented some user interactions and use of the CGAL data structure. The models I use to test my program came from the [UC Berkeley Computer Graphics](http://graphics.berkeley.edu) website :)

##Latest Changes
- Automatically find and fit model.  
- Maintain aspect ratio on window resize. 
- Select Color.
- Shading based on vertex normal vectors. 
- Rotation by mouse drag. 
- Zoom by right click mouse drag. 
- Option to move model by mouse drag. 


Just wanted to provide a short update and the demo. If you're interested, check back as I will go into more detail as time permits!
