A demo of my completed 3D Viewer project, written in C++. I also used OpenGL, GLSL, CGAL, and QT. I implemented user interactions including rotation, translation, and zoom by manipulating the viewing volume. The program also supports generation of 3-D volume mesh from surface mesh data. 

Just to clarify, my project is the viewing program itself! Not the models you see. I got the models I used to test my program from the UC Berkeley Computer Graphics group.
