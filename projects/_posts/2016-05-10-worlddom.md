This is my first ever 3D animated short. I worked with Charles Hager, Shu Wen Liu, Anh Le, Siddharth Bhogra. I wrote the story and directed the short, and worked with the team to model, rig, animate, texture, render, composite, and edit the film in Maya and AfterEffects. 

It's no masterpiece, but it was an exhilarating learning experience. 

I made this short in UCBUGG while I was taking a Computer Graphics class at Berkeley. The two classes were great compliments to each other. Working on my short gave the graphics concepts I was learning context, as I could see how each thing I learned applied to the animation pipeline. On the other hand, my graphics knowledge helped me understand things like why mesh topology is important, and what was going to be "expensive" to render when creating my short. Most importantly, the classes affirmed my interest in graphics and animation. I remember being up in the middle of the night babysitting my renders and finishing my fluid simulation graphics final. Despite the late hours, I felt so energized because I was working on two projects I loved. Being able to express yourself through technology and storytelling is such a gift!
