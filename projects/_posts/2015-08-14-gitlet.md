## Gitlet 
{% highlight java %}
My own version control system which mimics git, written in Java
/* I implemented git commands including 
* initialize 
* add, commit, remove
* log, global log
* find, status
* checkout
* branch, remove branch
* reset, merge, and rebase. */ 
I designed my own API and storage plan for this project.

## Beargit 
{% highlight c %}
Another git-mimic, written in C 
Every commit must contain "THIS IS BEAR TERRITORY!" or Beargit returns an error. 
/* My partner and I implemented 
* status, log
* rm
* commit 
* branch 
* checkout
* reset, merge. */ 
We also wrote cunit tests to check our program.
