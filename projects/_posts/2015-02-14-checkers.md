This was my first, and favorite CS61B data structures project. It is a simple checkers game with a few twists, written in Java. 

There are 3 kinds of pieces: pawns, bombs, and shields. Bombs (birds and bees) self destruct and destroy everything around them when they make a capture. Shields (roses) are protected from bomb explosions. Honeybears are pawns! Pieces become "crowned" when they reach the end of the board.
