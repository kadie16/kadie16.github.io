Growing up, I always dreamed of living abroad. I visited Italy when I was 13 and fell in love with travelling. I rember sitting on the spanish steps in rome, and thinking to myself "I have to study abroad someday". 

As time went on, I got busier and began to lose my fervor for studying abroad. I decided I wanted to study Chemical Engineering, and I threw all of my energy into transferring from Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) to a four year university. 

Three years later I was admitted to UC Berkeley. That summer, my friend Taylor from UC Santa Barbara kept a blog about her travels in Madrid. Every weekend I was so excited to read her new entry. I smiled and laughed and gasped as I read about her exploring Madrid, adventuring in Paris, and running with the Bulls in Barcelona. With each entry, my determination to study abroad was renewed.

Still, I had doubts about pulling it off. As an engineering transfer student, I felt this summer was the only time I could study abroad without delaying graduation. However, I thought if I traveled over summer I woulnd't be able to participate in an internship, which was another priority to me. Plus, I knew it would be expensive, and I was apprehensive to take out more loans. 

Then I found out about an opportunity to participate in a research internship in Singapore. I realized I didn't have to choose between gaining professional experience and travelling! This was really exciting, but I still had to figure out how to pay for it. 

I found out there were a lot of scholarships available to help students study abroad. I worked hard on my scholarship applications, and I ended up recieveing the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, the University of California Education Abroad Program Promise award, the Singapore International Pre Graduate Award, and two others. Now my trip is almost fully funded. 

My point is, there were several reasons I thought might keep me from fulfilling my dream to study abroad. But I ended up finding a program that was ideal for me, and a lot of resources to help me make it happen. 

Hopefully by sharing this, I can convey how possible it is to make your own adventure happen :)
